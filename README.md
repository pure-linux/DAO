All IP (Code, ..) of PureLinux is owned by the DAO and the DAO is owned by the [contributors][repo-contributors] of the DAO.

<blockquote>
 <span>
   We think that every contributor should have their fair stake within the projects. Most important for us is that barrier to contribution is as low as possible.
 </span>
</blockquote>

The project development is still very new, feel free to [![pure-linux-discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-join-7289DA.svg?logo=discord&longCache=true&style=flat)](https://discord.gg/ERKBk6ArnQ) for **open discussions** about container orchestration and so on.
We try to **scale** the **development** **with** the **community** so that the project achieves optimal momentum.
Because the **codebase** is in general relatively **small**, one doesn't have to dive too deep into prebuilt structures to make valuable contributions.
We try to give **best possible credit to every contributor** who's bringing this project to the world.

### Process for Stake Distribution

<blockquote>
 <span>
   It's not good for a project when someone digs themselves into a rabbit hole alone, because it makes it harder for others to join or contribute later.
 </span>
</blockquote>

At PureLinux, we try hard to build a decentralized autonomous organization to redefine how open-source **contributions** are **rewarded** and **governed**. We find this very important for the project to grow perfectly.
For every **contribution**, each contributor receives **tokens** for the DAO, increasing their **financial stake** and/or **influence** in **polls**, including those shaping PureLinux [Product Roadmaps][tinyo-roadmap] and potential future developments.

<blockquote>
 <span>
   It's not just about how big your seat is; it's more about how high the plane is flying.
 </span>
</blockquote>

Our mission is to create a **community-driven Linux¬Æ ecosystem** that ensures fairness, transparency, and accessibility for all [contributors][repo-contributors].
**Key features** of the organization will include:

- **Reward Mechanisms**: Valid contributions are rewarded through a transparent token system, ensuring every contributor receives a fair stake based on their personal efforts.
- **Quadratic Funding**: A funding mechanism that prioritizes community-backed initiatives, amplifying the impact of collective support.
- **Decentralized Governance**: Token holders actively participate in shaping the project's direction through votes, empowering [contributors][repo-contributors] to drive innovation.
- **Low Contribution Barriers**: We aim to make contributions seamless and rewarding, both on GitHub and beyond.

### Monetarization

Somehow the DAO needs to finance itself (the world is how it is..). Because of that we plan to implement the following monetarization strategies to pay the development of the open-source version of TIO:

- [Dashboard][tinyodash] Pro (Local/Server) [one-time payment]
- Managed services: [TIO Cloud][tinyocloud] Pro (based on [TIO Runtime][tinyort] Pro) [monthly payment]
- Professional support offering for TIO Pro Services [monthly payment]
